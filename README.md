Tiled
=========

Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for editing maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a Breakout clone.

Tiled is very flexible, for example there are no restrictions on map size, tile size or the number of layers or tiles. Also, it allows arbitrary properties to be set on the map, its layers, the tiles or on the objects. Its map format (TMX) is relatively easy to understand and allows a map to use multiple tilesets while also allowing each tileset to grow or shrink as necessary later.


It was originally written in java, but the orginal writer has since move to using Qt:

*Why try to fork the java version?*
I use the java version of tiled in my own work, and is a very vital part of another project I work on, the erebos game engine:
